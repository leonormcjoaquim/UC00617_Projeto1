# 🌐 Portfolio - Leonor Joaquim

This project is a school portfolio website created as part of my learning journey to practice working with Git and GitHub.
It is built to experiment with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and external libraries like Bootstrap and Typed.js, while implementing features such as responsiveness, animations, theme switching for light/dark mode, interactive components, and project showcases.
